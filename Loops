Loops in Python
Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. Python provides two types of loops:

for loop – Used for iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc.).
while loop – Executes as long as a condition remains True.
Syntax.
for variable in iterable:
    # Loop body (indented block of code)


'''
#Example 1

name = "Sai"

for i in name:
  print(i)

# Example 2
Listofname= ["Sai", "Sharan", "Varun"]

for j in Listofname:
  print(j)
  for k in j:
    print(k)

The range() function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in loops for iteration.
Syntax:
range(start, stop, step)
Parameters:

start (optional) - The beginning of the sequence (default is 0).
stop (required) - The end of the sequence (exclusive, meaning it stops before this value).
step (optional) - The difference between each number in the sequence (default is 1).

Key Points:
The range() function does not return a list in Python 3 but a range object, which is memory efficient.
You can convert it into a list using list(range(...)) if needed.
range() is commonly used in loops for iteration.

for i in range(0,5 ,2): # (0 is something where numbers start. 5 is the index where number should go and 2 is the difference between the number thatshould prit)
  print(i)
